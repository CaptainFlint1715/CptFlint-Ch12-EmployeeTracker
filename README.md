# Cpt.Flint-Ch12-EmployeeTracker

## Description

This project was undertaken with the intent to build a command-line application that acts as a content management system for a company's employee database. This interface incorporates Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL to allow a user to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company. Through the process of building this application, I was able to greatly expand and improve my understanding of how to use MySQL queries to foster an interactive experience between users and databases.

## Installation

Open the application in command line, type 'npm install'. Next, log in to mysql using 'mysql -u root -p' and then your password. Enter 'source db/schema.sql', press enter, and then enter 'source/db/seeds.sql' and press enter. This will set up the MySQL database. Next you can enter 'node index.js' to start the application.

## Usage

You will be presented with a menu containing a list of method options. Based on what you would like to do with the employee database, select an option, and if additional prompts are required, please provide appropriate answers. If you have chosen to display a table and wish to return to the menu, hold Ctrl-C and then reenter 'node index.js'.
